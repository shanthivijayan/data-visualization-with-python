**Data Visualization with Python**

**📌 Overview**

This repository demonstrates a wide range of data visualization techniques in Python, from basic plots to interactive dashboards. It showcases how complex datasets can be explored, analyzed, and presented visually to reveal insights.

These projects were completed using Jupyter Notebooks as part of my journey in IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate and personal practice.

**🎯 Purpose**

Data visualization is a key skill for data analysts. This repository aims to:

Illustrate different types of plots: line, bar, histogram, scatter, pie, box, bubble, area, and waffle charts.

Explore geospatial visualization techniques and dashboards.

Demonstrate the use of Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Show how to preprocess datasets and visualize insights clearly.

**🛠 Tools & Technologies**

Python: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colaboratory

Optional: Word Clouds, Geospatial Mapping Tools


**🔍 Key Skills Demonstrated**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python

Preprocessing and cleaning datasets for visualization

Creating both static and interactive charts

Building dashboard-style visualizations

Communicating data insights visually to support decisions
